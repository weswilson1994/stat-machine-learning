## Project Title

Understanding Police Stop Outcomes in Washington, D.C.

### Group Members

-   Jithendra Sadu

-   Samuel Mweni

-   Wesley Wilson

### Research Question

What factors influence police stop outcomes in Washington, D.C., and what are their implications for community-police interactions?

### Approaches

-   Predicting stop outcomes: Build a classification model to predict the outcome a police stop (e.g., ticket, warning, arrest) based on various factors such a demographics, time of day, or stop duration.

-   Will I be searched by the police?: Build a binary classification model capable of predicting the likeliness of a police search based on various factors such as demographics, time of day, stop duration, etc.

-   Predicting stop duration: Build a model to predict how long a police stop might last once initiated.

### Group Responsibilities

Each group member will be responsible for executing one of the approaches listed above from start to finish; this will include data preparation, model selection, diagnostics, and reporting final results for their respective sub-question. As the due date approaches, the group will convene and leverage our respective findings for our final write up and draft what implications these findings have on community policing.

### Deliverable: Option B (Report)
