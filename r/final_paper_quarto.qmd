## Introduction

Something, something, something...

## Research Question

What factors influence police stop outcomes in Washington, D.C., and what are their implications for community-police interactions?

## About the Data

## Methodology

models used, model selection, model diagnostics.

-   Predicting stop outcomes: Build a classification model to predict the outcome a police stop (e.g., ticket, warning, arrest) based on various factors such a demographics, time of day, or stop duration.

-   Will I be searched by the police?: Build a binary classification model capable of predicting the likeliness of a police search based on various factors such as demographics, time of day, stop duration, etc.

-   Predicting stop duration: Build a model to predict how long a police stop might last once initiated.

## Results
